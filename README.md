# Design patterns implemented in Java

# Introduction 

Design patterns are the best formalized practices a programmer can use to solve common problems when designing an application or system.

Design patterns can speed up the development process by providing tested, proven development paradigms.

Reusing design patterns help prevent subtle issues that cause major problems, and it also improves code readability for coders and architects who are familiar with the patterns.

# The Catalog of Design Patterns
<h3> Creational patterns </h3>
     <p> These patterns provide various object creation mechanisms, which increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.</p>

<h3> Structural patterns </h3>
     <p>  These patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.</p>
  
<h3> Behavioral patterns </h3>
    <p> These patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.</p>
